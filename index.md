# Annual Single Mingles Event  
### or: a social experiment potentially beyond my control

Hey hey you single lonely fucks and happily cuffed cucks - it's time for the annual single mingles event - except it's on a scale potentially beyond my control

---

## **Background:**

Last year we ran this and on a much smaller scale and ruined like 5 friendships - so here's take 2

Some of my pals are looking for love - and dating apps are horrible places - so as my gift to u - here's an event where you can find love

Also it was my bday on the 10th - and i want an excuse to shake ass w my pals

---

## **How it works:**

Each single person is assigned another single person -- e.g. A is assigned B, B assigned C, C assigned A etc. this means  
A must bring a single friend for B to go on the date with.

Everyone will go on their date simultaneously -- on the 23rd Jan -- everyone will go to Keble formal  
(for non-oxford uni ppl - it's a dinner in the fancy dining hall in Keble college  
**dresscode:** smart-casual)

Then everyone will go to the Oxford retreat after for a boogie  
(or another event (TBC) to shake ass)

## **Non-singles / couples / throuples:**

You're here for moral support / you can help find potential dates for when the singles can't find dates for the person they're assigned - please do come and bring your partner, coz I also just wanna see u!  
(I think most people in this chat are actually in very beautiful relationships <3)

**You don't need to partake in the singles mingling - you can just come and join for formal / any other part of the night!!**

*But if you want to partake in the singles dating part -- yeah you need to come for formal*

---

On **SUNDAY** I will pick names out of a hat or something to pick which single is assigned who

So ya'll have **5 days** to find someone.  
(sorry short notice oops)

---

## **What do I need to do to join? - How do I RSVP??**

**FILL IN THE GOOGLE FORM ASAP IF YOU WANNA JOIN --  
I'M SETTING A HARD DEADLINE FOR SUNDAY 18TH JAN - NOON MIDDAY**

(i'll send the google form tmr because i wanna sleep rn - but people be asking too many qs)

There's literally 2 main questions:

1. will you join for keble formal?
2. will you join for single mingle?

---

## **Details on the actual night**

1. Last year noone had a good time on their dates -- and I want everyone to mingle anyway for even friendship sake -- so even if you're a couple - after every course of the dinner everyone is going to have to switch places w someone
2. Formal is around £15 (for a 3 course meal) -- and £10 for a bottle of wine but if you're sneaky you can sneak in your own wine  
   (also keble wine is shit)
3. Formal is smart casual and starts at **7PM** so the night will begin at **6:30PM** - late.
